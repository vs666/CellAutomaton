## Cell Automaton

A cellular automaton (pl. cellular automata, abbrev. CA) is a discrete model studied in automata theory. Cellular automata are also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays. Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling. 

This [repository](https://github.com/vs666/CellAutomaton) is an attempt to learn and build a usable library for cellular-automaton code.

## Applications

Any tech is useful only if applicable. As it so happens, Cell Automaton is applicable in multiple areas. The relevent applications can be found under 
[Applications](https://github.com/vs666/CellAutomaton/tree/master/Applications) directory.
Also, executable files are available under [exe_files](https://github.com/vs666/CellAutomaton/tree/master/exe_files) directory.
